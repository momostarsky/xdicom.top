# Certificate Management System for Medical Imaging

The cert_helper.rs module provides comprehensive certificate management capabilities for securing medical imaging systems, implementing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) with X.509 certificates and OpenSSL integration.

## Security Architecture

### Certificate Authority (CA) Management
Implements a complete CA system for issuing and managing certificates within medical imaging environments.

### Client Certificate Generation
Generates client certificates with machine-specific bindings for enhanced security.

### Server Certificate Management
Creates server certificates for HTTPS and DICOM TLS connections.

## Key Features

### Automated Certificate Generation
- CA root certificate generation with 4096-bit RSA keys
- Client certificate issuance with custom extensions
- Server certificate creation for secure communications

### Certificate Validation
- Signature verification using public key cryptography
- Extension validation for machine-specific bindings
- Expiration date checking

### Machine Identity Binding
Uses custom X.509 extensions to bind certificates to specific machine identities, preventing certificate misuse.

## Technical Implementation

### OpenSSL Integration
Leverages OpenSSL for cryptographic operations including:
- RSA key generation (4096-bit for maximum security)
- X.509 certificate creation and signing
- Digital signature generation and verification
- Certificate parsing and validation

### Custom Extensions
Implements custom OID extensions for healthcare-specific requirements:
- Machine identity binding (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.15967132172.1)
- Healthcare organization identification

## Security Benefits

1. **End-to-End Encryption**: Secures data transmission between medical imaging systems
2. **Identity Verification**: Ensures only authorized systems can access sensitive data
3. **Non-Repudiation**: Digital signatures provide proof of data origin and integrity
4. **Compliance**: Meets healthcare security standards and regulations

## Healthcare-Specific Features

- **Machine Binding**: Prevents certificate copying between systems
- **Long-Term Validity**: 10-year certificate lifecycles for stable deployments
- **Organization Verification**: Certificate subject validation for healthcare entities
